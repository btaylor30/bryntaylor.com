Beginning with a home closet evaluation, I will help you see which new pieces could best complement your style. We will then meet to shop for up to three hours in carefully selected stores, where I will introduce you to a variety of new brands and styles to help you look your absolute best.</p>

<p><em>The shopping was so efficient, and I truly could not have found things that were so flattering on my own. In 3 hours, I did more with Bryn than I could do in 3 years. She had relationships with people in the stores that were able to find other things that were not in the store. I feel like it was a great gift to myself for the life and look I want.</em>
–Abby, investment banker</p>

<p><em>I am mildly obsessed with the jeans Bryn found for me. Would never have picked them out myself and now I can’t live without them.</em>
