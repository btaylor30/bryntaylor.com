<p><em>Bryn methodically reviewed every piece of clothing in my closets, carefully appraising for fit and style. I found her tactful and on-the-mark recommendations to purge items easy to follow, and together we pitched anything that didn’t fit, was too old, or was just unflattering.  Bryn then pieced together and photographed dozens of new outfits, which she later presented to me in a fabulous “Look Book”. The entire process was a delight, as was Bryn.</em> –Anne, strategic communications advisor</p>

        <p>Whether the idea of shopping overwhelms you, or you&#39;re simply looking for fresh ideas, the Shop with Me package offers intimate help navigating the stores. Beginning with a home closet evaluation, I will help you see which new pieces could best complement your style. We will then meet to shop for up to three hours in carefully selected stores, where I will introduce you to a variety of new brands and styles to help you look your absolute best.</p>

<h1>Includes:</h1>

<ul>
<li><h3>Closet Evaluation</h3>

<p>I will evaluate your current closet to decide which new pieces we will need to complete your wardrobe.</p></li>
<li><h3>Shopping Session + Pre-Pull</h3>

<p>Before you even set foot in the store, I will be at work for you selecting pieces and having them ready the minute you arrive. We will then go through the selections together to determine which pieces flatter you the most.</p></li>
<li><h3>Photo Lookbook</h3>

<p>I&#39;ll create a photo collage lookbook to show you how your amazing new clothes will fit in with your current wardrobe.</p></li>

<p><em>The shopping was so efficient, and I truly could not have found things that were so flattering on my own. In 3 hours, I did more with Bryn than I could do in 3 years. She had relationships with people in the stores that were able to find other things that were not in the store. I feel like it was a great gift to myself for the life and look I want.</em>
–Abby, investment banker</p>

<p><em>I am mildly obsessed with the jeans Bryn found for me. Would never have picked them out myself and now I can’t live without them.</em>

<p><em>I worked with Bryn to improve my professional image and I couldn&#39;t be happier with the results. She resurrected some clothes from my closet that just needed to be a part of the right ensemble; and she helped me shop for new clothes that were in my personal style, but just a better version of me. At work I&#39;m projecting the image I need, and my wife thinks I look awesome! Bryn and Berkshire Hathaway are my two best investments.</em> - Michael, marketing consultant</p>

<p><em>What I loved about our work together is that she instantly grasped my style sensibility and was able to get rid of items in my closet that were not me and replace with those that were.  Everything I now have works together beautifully and she has provided a focus to my eye that has given me the ability to continue integrating garments that will fit an overall strategy.</em> -Ann, freelance events planner</p>

<p><em>I do not like shopping (or picking out clothes to wear in general), but working with her was so much fun-- and insightful!  Beyond the process itself being fun, the look-book she created for me has saved me time and money, over and over again.  My mornings are now much more efficient-- thanks to the look-book, I know exactly what works and I no longer spend time agonizing over putting an outfit together.</em> -Michelle, attorney</p>

          <p>Shera needed help making her wardrobe more streamlined and cohesive to better serve her busy lifestyle. Together, we created a modern, functional collection that helps her look incredible from desk to dinner, to London, and back.</p>

          <p>For more casual workdays, Shera wanted something besides boring blue denim. Hunter green jeans proved to be equally as versatile with a grown-up twist. And her navy blazer is softer than basic black.</p>

      <p>As a personal stylist, my goal is to empower my clients through smart, sustainable style choices. I help both men and women understand the basics of great style, and how to achieve dress-and-go confidence every day.</p>
      <p>I've worked in many areas of the fashion industry, from design to merchandising to online media, which has allowed me to gain an insider's perspective. From a personal standpoint, I know firsthand the effects of wardrobe anxiety and image-related frustrations. Pulling from both experiences, I'm able to offer my clients a sincere, professional, and lighthearted approach to mastering great style.</p>
      <p>Since its launch in 2011, my business (formerly named The Re-Stylist) has served clients in both New York and San Francisco, and has been featured on several media outlets including <a href="http://www.ehow.com/videos-on_12220734_fashion-women-over-40.html">eHow.com</a> and Dr. Oz's <a href="http://www.youbeauty.com/body-fitness/restyle-your-wardrobe">YouBeauty</a>. As of 2013, I now work with clients from all over the globe with my signature virtual styling program. I'd love to work with you!</p>
