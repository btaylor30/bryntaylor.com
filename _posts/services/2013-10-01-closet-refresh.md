Ever feel like you have a closet full of nothing to wear? Do you wonder if your clothes are even that flattering? The Closet Refresh will teach you how to spot what is and is not working for you, and how to use what you have to create a more exciting wardrobe. Learn what silhouettes, styles, and colors suit you best, and how to confidently mix and match your clothes to create incredible new looks.
 
# Includes:
 
- ### Closet Edit
We will go through your wardrobe piece by piece and discuss which clothes flatter you the most, and which crucial items you’re missing.
 
- ### Outfit Creation
I’ll put together new outfits from the pieces already in your closet.
 
- ### Photo Lookbook
You'll receive a personalized lookbook that features high-res photos of all your new ensembles.

*Bryn methodically reviewed every piece of clothing in my closets, carefully appraising for fit and style. I found her tactful and on-the-mark recommendations to purge items easy to follow, and together we pitched anything that didn’t fit, was too old, or was just unflattering.  Bryn then pieced together and photographed dozens of new outfits, which she later presented to me in a fabulous “Look Book”. The entire process was a delight, as was Bryn.* –Anne, strategic communications advisor
