Whether the idea of shopping overwhelms you, or you're simply looking for fresh ideas, the Shop with Me package offers intimate help navigating the stores. Beginning with a home closet evaluation, I will help you see which new pieces could best complement your style. We will then meet to shop for up to three hours in carefully selected stores, where I will introduce you to a variety of new brands and styles to help you look your absolute best.
 
# Includes:
 
- ### Closet Evaluation
I will evaluate your current closet to decide which new pieces we will need to complete your wardrobe.
 
- ### Shopping Session + Pre-Pull
Before you even set foot in the store, I will be at work for you selecting pieces and having them ready the minute you arrive. We will then go through the selections together to determine which pieces flatter you the most.
 
- ### Photo Lookbook
I'll create a photo collage lookbook to show you how your amazing new clothes will fit in with your current wardrobe.
 
*The shopping was so efficient, and I truly could not have found things that were so flattering on my own. In 3 hours, I did more with Bryn than I could do in 3 years. She had relationships with people in the stores that were able to find other things that were not in the store. I feel like it was a great gift to myself for the life and look I want.*
–Abby, investment banker
 
*I am mildly obsessed with the jeans Bryn found for me. Would never have picked them out myself and now I can’t live without them.*
