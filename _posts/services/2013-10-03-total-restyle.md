*I worked with Bryn to improve my professional image and I couldn't be happier with the results. She resurrected some clothes from my closet that just needed to be a part of the right ensemble; and she helped me shop for new clothes that were in my personal style, but just a better version of me. At work I'm projecting the image I need, and my wife thinks I look awesome! Bryn and Berkshire Hathaway are my two best investments.* - Michael, marketing consultant

*What I loved about our work together is that she instantly grasped my style sensibility and was able to get rid of items in my closet that were not me and replace with those that were.  Everything I now have works together beautifully and she has provided a focus to my eye that has given me the ability to continue integrating garments that will fit an overall strategy.* -Ann, freelance events planner
 
*I do not like shopping (or picking out clothes to wear in general), but working with her was so much fun-- and insightful!  Beyond the process itself being fun, the look-book she created for me has saved me time and money, over and over again.  My mornings are now much more efficient-- thanks to the look-book, I know exactly what works and I no longer spend time agonizing over putting an outfit together.* -Michelle, attorney
