Don't live in New York or San Francisco? You can still benefit from my expertise from the comforts of your own home. Choose from one of my two remote styling options below.

### Personalized Style Report
## $150

How often do you see something you love online or on the store mannequin, but when you try it on it just doesn't fit right--bagging in some places, clinging in others. With this virtual service, I'll give you a complete analysis of what styles and silhouettes will flatter you best. I'll also give you a list of stores and brand names that work specifically for your body type, lifestyle, and budget.

### Skype Style Session
## $245

Using Skype, we will choose specific areas of your wardrobe to focus on. We'll discuss new ideas for outfits, how items fit you, and what you can do to re-energize this area of your wardrobe. You will receive a recording of our session plus a shopping list that includes links to where you can buy the items you need.

*I live in North Carolina, and needed help dressing for my new life as a mom. Through Skype, Bryn helped me come up with a plan that makes me feel happy to get dressed everyday. I was so doubtful at first that this could be done remotely, but it was perfect. I felt like Bryn was in my closet with me the whole time.* - Caroline, mom
